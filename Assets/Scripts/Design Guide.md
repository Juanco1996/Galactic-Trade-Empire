### **Color and Font Design Guide for Galactic Trading Idle Game**

---

#### **1. Core Theme and Feel**
The game’s aesthetic revolves around **space, trade, and advanced technology**. The design should evoke a sense of exploration, progress, and sophistication, while being minimalistic to suit an idle game’s UI-focused nature. Colors and fonts should balance functionality (clarity) with atmosphere.

### **2. Color Palette**
The palette is inspired by the **cosmic/galactic** theme, with emphasis on deep space tones, glowing accents, and metallic highlights. 

#### **Primary Colors**  
These dominate the UI and gameplay elements.

- **Void Black (#0D0D12)**: Secondary backgrounds and separators.  

#### **Accent Colors**  
Used for interactivity and progression indicators.  
- **Cosmic Cyan (#38E8E8)**: Highlights active UI elements like buttons, progress bars, and tier unlocks.  
- **Galactic Purple (#7E5BD4)**: Used for resources related to Void Opals, Void Dust, or special features.  
- **Nebula Orange (#F79F46)**: Reward notifications, upgrade highlights, and critical attention points.  

#### **Support Colors**  
Used for readability and feedback.  
- **Stellar White (#EAEAEA)**: Text and static information.

### **3. Gradients and Effects**

- **Progress Bars and Active Elements**: Glowing effects with gradient transitions like **Cosmic Cyan → Nebula Orange**.  
- **Void Features**: Incorporate particle-like glows with **Galactic Purple → Stellar White** transitions for ethereal effects.

### **4. Fonts**
Fonts must prioritize readability while fitting the futuristic and cosmic theme.

#### **Primary Font** (Headlines and Resource Names)
- **Exo 2** (Google Fonts):  
  - Style: Sans-serif, futuristic, highly readable.  
  - Weight: Use **bold** for emphasis and medium for secondary headers.  
  - Example Usage: "STAR HARVESTER", "VOID OPALS PRODUCED".

#### **Secondary Font** (Body Text and Descriptions)
- **Roboto** (Google Fonts):  
  - Style: Clean, minimal, and modern sans-serif.  
  - Weight: Use **regular** for descriptive text, **light** for less critical information.  
  - Example Usage: "Each Star Harvester produces 10 Cosmic Credits per second."

#### **Monospace Font** (Optional, for Numbers or Special Stats)
- **Space Mono** (Google Fonts):  
  - Adds a "techy" feel for numbers, production rates, or resource stats.  
  - Example Usage: "10,000 CC/sec", "Void Dust x2.5".

### **5. UI Design Principles**
- **Minimalism**: Avoid clutter; display only the most important information for the player at any given time.
- **Hierarchy**: Use font weights, sizes, and colors to differentiate headlines, key stats, and secondary information.
- **Consistency**: Keep buttons, text, and resources visually consistent to avoid confusion.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Buttons and interactable elements glow slightly when hovered, pressed, or unlocked.

- **Resources Display**:  
  - **Cosmic Cyan** numbers for current resources.  
  - **Stellar White** for static labels (e.g., "Cosmic Credits").  

#### **Buttons**

- Active: Filled **Cosmic Cyan** with glowing effect.  
- Locked: Void Black background with **Warning Red** text or icon.
